# ProjekOsom

A Malaysian version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Though, it is very similar.

It is called Osom (I think this is the way it's spelled idk) or maybe in certain states in Malaysia they called it by a different name.

So basically, the game is played by only two person AND there are three options. 
Rock, Bird and Water.
The rule is:-
Rock beats Bird
Bird beats Water
Water beats Rock


I know the code is a mess but please bare with me. I am stll not an expert.
Hopefully this is not the finalized version. I'll be making my way back here once I have found some free time.
